# Memory Kings in Python 3

memorykings0.5.py stable running all rules for Multiplayer and Solo modes on Terminal. Stage: 90-99%

main.py runs the game in Pygame. Stage: 70-80%

## TODO

- Queen's advice/peek
- Showing score on the window

## NON STANDARD MODULES

For main: import pygame

For old_versions/memorykings0.5.py: import pyinputplus, termcolor

## EXCUSES

memorykings0.5.py: Players' Pawns on the same card will only show one of them, cause it's a mess to draw a better board with ASCII. (They are there though.)
main.py: Is not done yet.
