# Memory Kings in Python 3

For now, the game runs with all its rules for Multiplayer and Solo modes on Terminal.

## TODO

Currently working on adding grahics with Pygame.

## NON STANDARD MODULES

pyinputplus, termcolor

## EXCUSES

Known Bug: Players' Pawns on the same card will only show one of them, cause it's a mess to draw a better board with ASCII. They are there though.)
